# Installation

Welcome to **Mirchi UI** — a fast, modern, and lightweight UI component library built for developers who want clean, reusable, and production-ready components.

---

## 1. Install Utilities

Mirchi UI components rely on **Tailwind CSS v4**  
Make sure Tailwind is installed & configured in your Next.js project:

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nextjs

Many Mirchi UI components also use the `cn` utility function.  
Add it via our CLI:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://mirchiui.dev/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://mirchiui.dev/r/utils.json
```
```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpx shadcn@latest add https://mirchiui.dev/r/utils.json
```
</Tabs>

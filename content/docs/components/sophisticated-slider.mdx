import ParallaxSlider from "@/components/modules/Sliders/parallaxSlider";

<ParallaxSlider />
```
## Overview

A dark, elegant hero slider focused on clarity and motion restraint. It combines fade transitions, subtle parallax effects, and circular navigation to create a premium, distraction-free experience.

Ideal for portfolio hero sections, agency landing pages, and modern product showcases.
 

## Customization

Slide content, gradients, autoplay timing, and animations can be adjusted directly from the internal `slides` configuration or Swiper settings inside the component.

This component is intentionally opinionated to maintain a clean visual hierarchy and consistent motion behavior.
